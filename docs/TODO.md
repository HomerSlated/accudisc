# AccuDisc — deferred work

Ideas parked for a later session. Not scheduled; not commitments. Recovery
methods are considered complete (see `docs/ACCUDISC_RECOVERY.md`); this is
everything else worth remembering.

## Probes / diagnostics

- **Timed-read cache detection.** Borrowed from libcdio-paranoia
  (`cdrom_cache_handler`): a re-read that returns implausibly fast was
  served from the drive's cache, not the platter. Paranoia flags a backseek
  read completing in under ~6 ms. Use it as a probe that *verifies our
  cache-defeat actually works* on a given drive — time a normal read, then
  time a re-read at our 5000-sector flush distance; if the re-read is not
  meaningfully slower, the flush distance is too small for this drive's
  cache and every "independent" reread (c2_retries, verify, consensus,
  c2lag) is silently reading cache. Report-only, per-drive, like the other
  probes. Would also let the flush distance auto-tune instead of being a
  fixed constant.

## Deferred (explicitly, by user decision)

- Python / Rust bindings (generated against `include/accudisc/*.h` only).
- Man page (must mirror `docs/ATTRIBUTION.md`).
- Write / burn (DAO) path — paused; do not start without direction.
